    <h4>Recipe Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li>Put a roasting tin in the oven (one big enough to take the potatoes in a single layer) and heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.</li>
<li>Peel 1kg potatoes and cut each into 4 even-sized pieces if they are medium size, 2-3 if smaller (5cm pieces).</li>
<li>Drop the potatoes into a large pan and pour in enough water to barely cover them.</li>
<li>Add salt, then wait for the water to boil. As soon as the water reaches a full rolling boil, lower the heat, put your timer on and simmer the potatoes uncovered, reasonably vigorously, for 2 mins.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, put 100g duck or goose fat or 100ml olive oil into the hot roasting tin and heat it in the oven for a few minutes, so it’s really hot.</li>
<li>Drain the potatoes in a colander, then shake the colander back and forth a few times to fluff up the outsides.</li>
<li>Sprinkle with 2 tsp flour and give another shake or two so they are evenly and thinly coated.</li>

<li>Carefully put the potatoes into the hot fat – they will sizzle as they go in – then turn and roll them around so they are coated all over.</li>
<li>Spread them in a single layer making sure they have plenty of room.</li>
<li>Roast the potatoes for 15 mins, then take them out of the oven and turn them over.</li>
<li>Roast for another 15 mins and turn them over again. Put them back in the oven for another 10-20 mins, or however long it takes to get them really golden and crisp. The colouring will be uneven, which is what you want.</li>
<li>Scatter with the sea salt flakes and serve straightaway.</li>
