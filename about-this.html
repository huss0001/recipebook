    <h4>What We Used Each Resources For:</h4>
<ul>
<li>VSCODE - This was used to create html files for each page.</li>
<li>TERMINAL - This was used to create a local repository that we could connect to the remote repository on GitHub.</li>
<li>NETLIFY - This was used to deploy the website and was connected to GitHub repository so changes could be automatically deployed.</li>
<li>GITHUB - This was to store all the project items. We also used GitHub to collaborate and create our own branches which we would push changes to the remote repository to review pull requests. Once the pull request is approved, we would merge the changes with the main branch. </li>
<li>WHIMSICAL - This was used to create a visual representation of our layout and structure. </li>
